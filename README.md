Data At Rest
This module deals with data at rest. Data at rest may be kept in:

files,
relational databases (e.g., SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle), 
NoSQL datastores (e.g., MongoDB)
Graph databases (e.g., Neo4J)
and more. 
We'll look at how to read and write from files and relational databases.

Data at rest is only part of the story. In analytics, there is also data in motion. Data in motion is unbounded - infinite - and is covered in our program course on Streaming Data.That was amusing too
